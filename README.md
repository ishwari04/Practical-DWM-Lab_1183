## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of various Data Warehousing and Mining (DWM) practicals completed as part of the Semester VI curriculum. The practicals cover topics such as data preprocessing, transformation, OLAP operations, and key machine learning algorithms used in data mining.

## Practicals Implemented

1. **Handling Missing Values in Python**  
   Techniques such as mean/mode imputation, interpolation, and row removal are applied to manage missing data.

2. **Data Flow Transformations in ETL**  
   Implementation of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, including filtering, aggregation, and schema mapping for data preprocessing.

3. **OLAP Operations on a Multi-Dimensional Data Cube**  
   Exploration of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) operations like roll-up, drill-down, slice, and dice for analytical processing.

4. **Apriori Algorithm for Frequent Itemset Mining**  
   Implementation of the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets in transactional datasets and generate association rules based on support and confidence thresholds.

5. **Naïve Bayes Algorithm**  
   Implementation of a Naïve Bayes classifier for tasks such as text classification and probabilistic prediction.

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm**  
   Implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification tasks with evaluation for different values of K.

7. **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**  
   Implementation of the K-Means algorithm for unsupervised clustering. Includes visualization of clustered data.

8. **Decision Tree Algorithm**  
   Construction of a decision tree classifier using information gain and entropy for rule generation and classification.

9. **Linear Regression**  
   Application of linear regression to model relationships between variables. Evaluation metrics include RMSE and R² score.
